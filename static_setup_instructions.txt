# Django might be looking for a 'theme' module that doesn't exist
# You should create a proper structure for static files in your Django project

# First, make sure you have the following structure:
# - yourproject/
#   - static/
#     - css/
#       - style.css (this is where you should save your CSS)

# In your settings.py, ensure you have:
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'static',
]

# Then in your templates, load static files with:
# {% load static %}
# <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">
